## ðŸš€ Getting Started

#### Demo Mode (Try it now!)

Want to explore NarevAI with sample data? Start with demo mode - no setup required:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name narev-billing-demo \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -e DEMO="true" \
  ghcr.io/narevai/narev:latest
```

âœ… **NarevAI is now running at: `http://localhost:8000`**

**Demo mode includes:**
- Sample billing data from AWS, Azure, and GCP
- Realistic usage patterns and cost data
- Pipeline run history
- **No encryption key needed!** Demo mode automatically generates one for you.

#### Production Setup

Ready for your real data? Deploy with your own encryption key:

First, generate an encryption key:

```bash
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

Then run the container with your generated key:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name narev-billing \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY="gAAAAABhZ_your_actual_generated_key_here" \
  -e ENVIRONMENT="production" \
  ghcr.io/narevai/narev:latest
```
